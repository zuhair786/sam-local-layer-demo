For clear understanding of aws lambda container support introduced in 2020.

we build a base image off the aws provided container to add in support for databases (for example) we 
needed to install dependencies. when we run sam local invoke, no matter what we do it uses the upstream container anyways.

if we can's install extra dependencies for postgres or mariadb, etc etc sam local is nearly useless.

sam build builds an image with the dep in it, we put a little wrapper script in the image to test if 
the dependency can be loaded and is present. You can see this output during sam build. However when you run sam local invoke, no matter what flags we pass it, it always uses the upstream aws image.
